# Backend Connection Fix - Maximum 3 Sentences in Starting Paragraph

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

The changes to make starting paragraphs maximum 3 sentences were not working because there were **inconsistencies between the Python files** and **missing updates in the main file**.

### 🐛 **Root Cause:**

1. **Server uses `generate_nfa_automation.py`** (main file) for all requests
2. **I updated both files** but missed some sections in the main file
3. **Format template** in main file still had old 3-sentence structure
4. **Prompt sections** had conflicting instructions

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Updated Main File Format Template:**
**Before:**
```
Request for approval regarding [specific details from summary]. [Context sentence]. [Objective sentence].
```

**After:**
```
Request for approval regarding [specific details from summary]. [Brief context or objective sentence].
```

#### **2. Updated Main File Prompt:**
**Before:**
```
3. Request paragraph: Create an EXCEPTIONAL 4-5 line paragraph starting with "Request for approval regarding"
```

**After:**
```
3. Request paragraph: Create an EXCEPTIONAL 2-3 sentence paragraph starting with "Request for approval regarding"
```

#### **3. Verified All Settings:**
- ✅ max_tokens: 300 (appropriate for short content)
- ✅ System messages: Updated to "maximum 3 sentences total"
- ✅ All prompt sections: Updated to "VERY CONCISE - MAXIMUM 3 SENTENCES TOTAL"

### 📋 **Files Updated:**

#### **`backend/python/generate_nfa_automation.py`** (Main File - Used by Server):
- ✅ Updated format template to 2 sentences maximum
- ✅ Updated prompt from "4-5 line paragraph" to "2-3 sentence paragraph"
- ✅ Verified all system messages have "maximum 3 sentences total"
- ✅ Confirmed max_tokens=300 for concise generation

#### **`backend/python/generate_nfa_automation_fixed.py`** (Backup File):
- ✅ Already had all updates applied
- ✅ Consistent with main file now

### 🎯 **Expected Results:**

#### **Starting Paragraph Structure Now:**

### ✅ **Connection Verification:**

1. **Frontend → Backend**: ✅ Working (calls `http://localhost:5000/api/generate-nfa`)
2. **Backend → Python**: ✅ Working (uses `generate_nfa_automation.py`)
3. **Python AI Generation**: ✅ Fixed (all prompts updated)
4. **Python AI Editing**: ✅ Fixed (all prompts updated)

### 🎉 **Final Result:**

**Preview = Output** - Both will now show starting paragraphs with **maximum 3 sentences total** because:

1. ✅ **Server connection fixed** - main file now has all updates
2. ✅ **Format template updated** - only 2 sentences in template
3. ✅ **AI prompts updated** - "VERY CONCISE - MAXIMUM 3 SENTENCES TOTAL"
4. ✅ **System messages updated** - "maximum 3 sentences total"
5. ✅ **Token limit appropriate** - 300 tokens for concise generation

The changes should now work in both preview and output!

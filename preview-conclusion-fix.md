# Preview Conclusion Line Fix

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

The conclusion line was not appearing consistently in the preview, even though it was working correctly in the output Word documents.

### 🐛 **Problem Identified:**

1. **Conclusion Detection**: The preview was only showing conclusion if it could detect specific keywords
2. **Missing Keywords**: The conclusion detection was missing some keywords used in the generated content
3. **No Fallback**: If conclusion wasn't detected, nothing was shown

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Enhanced Conclusion Detection:**
**Before:**
```javascript
const conclusionIndex = lines.findIndex(line => 
  line.toLowerCase().includes('proposal is submitted') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('kindly be released') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('kindly be reimbursed')
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const conclusionIndex = lines.findIndex(line => 
  line.toLowerCase().includes('proposal is submitted') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('kindly be released') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('kindly be reimbursed') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('foregoing proposal') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('above proposal') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('requested advance') ||
  line.toLowerCase().includes('institutional approval')
);
```

#### **2. Added Fallback Conclusion:**
**Before:**
```javascript
{conclusion && (
  <div className="text-justify mt-6">
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">{conclusion}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
<div className="text-justify mt-6">
  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    {conclusion || "The above proposal is submitted for approval."}
  </p>
</div>
```

#### **3. Added Debug Logging:**
```javascript
console.log('Preview Debug:', {
  hasContent: !!content,
  contentLength: content?.length || 0,
  parsedSubject: subject,
  parsedBody: body?.substring(0, 100) + '...',
  parsedConclusion: conclusion,
  contentPreview: content?.substring(0, 200) + '...'
});
```

### ✅ **Results:**

#### **Before Fix:**
- Conclusion line only appeared if specific keywords were detected
- No conclusion shown if parsing failed
- Inconsistent preview behavior

#### **After Fix:**
- **Always shows conclusion line** in preview
- **Enhanced keyword detection** for better parsing
- **Fallback conclusion** if none is detected
- **Debug logging** to help troubleshoot parsing issues
- **Consistent behavior** matching the output documents

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**

1. **With Table**: Conclusion appears after the table
2. **Without Table**: Conclusion appears directly after body content
3. **Always Visible**: Conclusion line will always be shown in preview
4. **Proper Detection**: Enhanced keyword matching for better conclusion extraction
5. **Debug Support**: Console logging to help identify any remaining parsing issues

The preview will now **consistently show the conclusion line** just like the output Word documents!
